<p>Today was my last day of summer vacation. I'm really looking forward to being busy again so I can properly work on my hobbies... (This might be something I regret saying!)</p>
<p>I seem to get my motivation most when I'm busy, so it's great for me.</p>
<p>My comic is everything I've wanted to do. I really hope it turns out well. Comic-making is really difficult and I want to make it more fun.</p>
<p>Today I visited my friend at a cafe I hope to work at soon.</p>
<p>I feel very very great and loved today.</p>
<p>I really only had a proper conversation with two people today...Gab and Fri, so thank you for being there. Here's my shoutout.</p>
<p>I'm not doing all of this every day I just need something to put here...</p>
<p>Good night!</p>
